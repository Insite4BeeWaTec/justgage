Modified and updated version of: http://justgage.com

# Versions

## 1.0.3
Added feature to set border color of the gauge.
Improved quellcode.

## 1.0.0
Because of the fork we will continue the version from 1.0.0
This version is mostly used for the initial commit.
Also we moved the "max" from "refresh" to his own function -> setNewMax
The same happened to min. You can now change the minimum label over -> setNewMin

Because of the library overhead we removed some features -> numberFormat, minTxt, maxTxt, reverse
At a later time, those features will come back. But currently its a clean up process.
